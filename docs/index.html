        Dart by Example - WIP!

      <p class="subtitle">
        Dart is a general-purpose programming language originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-408).
It is used to build web, server, and mobile applications.

Dart is an object-oriented, class defined, garbage-collected language using a C-style syntax. 
It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, static typing, and a sound type system.
        
        
        Developers at Google and elsewhere use Dart to create high-quality, mission-critical apps for iOS, Android, and the web. With features aimed at client-side development, Dart is a great fit for both mobile and web apps.

        Dart is free and open source, developed on GitHub.
